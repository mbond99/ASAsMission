ASA is a robot programmed with the A* algorithm. Players get to choose a land type between grass, forest, water, and lava for each section of the land grid. Each land type has a different movement cost that will be used in the A* algorithm calculations. Each land type also has a percentage chance of ASA being hit by enemy fire with the land types with the lowest movement cost having the highest percentage chance of being hit and the land types with the highest movement cost having the lowest percentage chance of being hit. Players must create a strategy to choose the best land grid while taking into consideration movement cost, percentage of ASA being hit by enemies, and the optimal path that will be calculated by the A* algorithm.
